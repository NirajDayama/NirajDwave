D-Wave Project Workflow (Student Guide)This guide explains how to build, test, and solve your optimization problem.Step 1: Run the Solver LocallyFirst, just run the student_solver.py script on your own machine:python student_solver.py
This will:Build your "Factory Upgrade" CQM problem.Solve it using the local ExactCQMSolver. This runs on your computer and needs no API key.Print the best solution it finds.Automatically create a new file: my_model_for_teacher.json.If your problem is small (like this one), the local solution is perfect!Step 2: Send Your Model to Your TeacherIf you make your problem much bigger (e.g., adding many new variables), the ExactCQMSolver will become too slow or crash with a MemoryError.When this happens, you need to use the D-Wave cloud solvers.Find the file my_model_for_teacher.json that was created in Step 1.Email this file to your teacher.Your teacher will run this model on the D-Wave hybrid solvers using their API key.Step 3: Load the Results from Your TeacherYour teacher will send you back a results file named results_from_teacher.json.Save this file in the same directory as your student_solver.py script.Run your script again:python student_solver.py
This time, the script will see the results_from_teacher.json file, load it, and print the solution found by the powerful D-Wave cloud sampler. You can then compare the local solution (if it finished) with the cloud solution.
